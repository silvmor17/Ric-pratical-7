B.Perform the Stratified sampling for the given data and analyse it.
we are to carry out a hypothetical housing quality survey across Lagos state, Nigeria.
And we looking at a total of 5000 houses (hypothetically). We don’t just go to one local
government and select 5000 houses, rather we ensure that the 5000 houses are a
representative of the whole 20 local government areas Lagos state is comprised of. This
is called stratified sampling. The population is divided into homogenous strata and the
right number of instances is sampled from each stratum to guarantee that the test-set
(which in this case is the 5000 houses) is a representative of the overall population. If
we used random sampling, there would be a significant chance of having bias in the
survey results.

output:


info 
There’s a ton of information we can mine from the heatmap above, a couple of strongly
positively correlated features and a couple of negatively correlated features. Take a look
at the small bright box right in the middle of the heatmap from total_rooms on the left
’y-axis’ till households and note how bright the box is as well as the highly positively
correlated attributes, also note that median_income is the most correlated feature to the
target which is median_house_value.
info 
From the image above, we can see that most median incomes are clustered between
$20,000 and $50,000 with some outliers going far beyond $60,000 making the
distribution skew to the right.
